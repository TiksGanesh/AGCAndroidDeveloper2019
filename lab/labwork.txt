Build and Run Application

Create a new Android project from the Empty Template.
● Add logging statements for various log levels in onCreate() in the main activity.
● Create an emulator for a device, targeting any version of Android you like, and run the app.
● Use filtering in Logcat to find your log statements and adjust the levels to only display debug
or error logging statements.
